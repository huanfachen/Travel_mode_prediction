# Travel mode prediction
Matlab and Python codes for travel mode prediction using statistical and machine learning models.

## Python code for machine learning models

1. You will need [Anaconda Python](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual#download-section) (Python 3) to be able to install and use the programming environment.
2. Install the conda environment. This yaml file has passed tests in Windows 10 and Windows Subsystem Linux (Linux 4.4.0-19041-Microsoft x86_64).
```
conda-env create -f travel_mode_pred.yml
```
3. To make this new env visible in jupyter notebook you then need to run the following two commands.

```
conda activate travel_model_pred
python -m ipykernel install --name travel_mode_pred
```

4. Activate the environment using **jupyter notebook**, and switch to the installed kernel.
5. Run the notebook of **Travel_mode_prediction_London_ML_Oversampling_v2.ipynb**.
